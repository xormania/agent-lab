# Security

`agent-lab` treats agent workloads as hostile or compromised. A broken experiment is acceptable; a silent boundary bypass is not.

## Secret Policy

Never commit real secrets. This includes API keys, tokens, private keys, SSH keys, browser profiles, cloud credentials, password-manager data, `.env`, `.env.local`, `secrets/`, runtime state, model caches, and generated logs.

Only `.env.example` belongs in source, and it must contain non-secret placeholders or safe defaults. Future real credentials should be files under `secrets/`, mounted read-only per service. Do not place real secrets in environment variables; env leaks through Docker inspection and process metadata.

Concretely: `docker inspect` exposes a container's `Config.Env`, which includes image `ENV`, compose `environment:`, and `--env-file` values — so a secret passed any of those ways is visible to anyone who can inspect the container. The `agent` profile instead bind-mounts `secrets/` read-only and the baked-in entrypoint (`tools/agent-entrypoint.sh`) reads each file and exports it at runtime. Runtime-exported variables do not appear in `docker inspect`. The residual exposure is `/proc` inside the container — i.e. the agent that already holds the key.

## Hard Stops

Stop work and report before continuing if tracked source contains or introduces:

- Real secret, token, API key, private key, browser profile, SSH key, or cloud credential.
- `.env`, `.env.local`, private env files, `secrets/`, runtime state, browser profiles, model caches, or key material.
- Docker socket mounts.
- Host home-directory mounts.
- `network_mode: host`.
- Privileged containers.
- Public port bindings by default.
- Agent/test containers attached directly to the internet-capable `egress` network.
- Agent containers with both broad credentials and open internet.
- Direct internet paths from agents that bypass the proxy.
- Security claims that are not implemented and tested.

## Network Rules

Agent and test containers must attach only to the internal `agents` network. Only `egress-proxy` may attach to both `agents` and `egress`.

No service publishes public ports in v0. Future operator-facing ports must bind to `127.0.0.1` unless explicitly approved.

The Docker socket must never be mounted into an agent container. Host home directories, SSH directories, cloud-drive roots, browser profiles, and password-manager data must never be mounted into agent containers.

## Allowlist Limitation

Domain allowlisting controls where traffic can go. It does not control what an agent sends to an allowed destination. If `example.com` is allowlisted, a compromised agent can send data to `example.com`.

## Vulnerability Reporting

**This is a closed project.** Do not open public GitHub issues for security matters.

Report suspected boundary bypasses, secret exposure, or dangerous defaults to the repository owner through the private project channel used for this repository.
